# MovieGenreClassifcation
## Genre Classification with Machine Learning

### Overview:
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to classify movie genres based on their descriptions. By employing natural language processing (NLP) and logistic regression, we aim to predict the genre of a movie given its textual description. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, validation, and evaluation stages.

### Features:
- **Data Exploration**: Explore the distribution of movie genres to gain insights into the dataset.
- **Text Cleaning**: Implement text cleaning techniques such as lowercase conversion, URL removal, and stop-word elimination to preprocess the textual data effectively.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transform the cleaned text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.
- **Model Training**: Utilize logistic regression with multinomial classification to train the model on the transformed text data.
- **Validation and Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on validation data using accuracy metrics and generate a classification report for detailed insights.
- **Prediction**: Apply the trained model to predict genres for the test data and compare predictions with actual genres.
